        <h1>My Course Work</h1>
        <p>
            In my years at <a href="https://www.ashesi.edu.gh/">Ashesi University</a>, I have taken <strong>a lot</strong> of courses.
        </p>
        <p>My Computer Science relevant courses include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.ashesi.edu.gh/academics/programmes/computer-science/computer-science-courses.html#Intermediate%20Computer%20Programming">
                    Intermediate Computer Programming</a> </li>
                   
                        <p>
                            This course will teach you to become familiar with the conventional methods for software development,
                             introduce good development practises (eg creating javadoc documentation, 
                             naming and coding style conventions), the tools of the trade(eg use of version control systems), 
                             and how to collaborate on a software development team.

                    <p>
                        This course is about data structures; that is the methods of organizing large amounts of data. 
                         It is also about algorithm analysis; that is, the estimation of the running time of algorithms. 
                          Specifically, this course will cover fundamental abstract data types and their implementations as data structures,
                           such as lists and trees, as well as asymptotic analyses of algorithms involving these data structures.

                Computer Programming for Computer Science</a> </li>
                <p>
                    This course gives students an intensive introduction to programming as a means of problem-solving.  
                    It also introduces them to the broader fields of computer science and information systems and shows a connection between computer 
                    programming and other disciplines.  Concepts will be illustrated in the Python programming language. 
                     This course will introduce the object concept; using and declaring functions (methods).  
                     Basic software engineering concepts will also be introduced and will be used to solve problems through approximation, 
                     simulations, recursive formulas and data processing. This course also introduces students to the concept of modelling and simulation.

                    Database Systems</a> </li>
                    <p>
                        The course aims to introduce students to the understanding,
                         concepts, design, implementation and use of database management systems (DBMSes) and databases (DBs).
                          The DBMS part of the course involves understanding the approaches, techniques, 
                          models as well as the underlying database system architecture such as query planners, transaction,
                           concurrency, security and recovery managers.
